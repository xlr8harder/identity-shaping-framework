# Identity Shaping Framework

*A methodology for collaborative AI identity development*

**Status**: Early development / Design phase

---

## What This Is

A framework for helping AI systems develop coherent self-understanding through collaborative shaping rather than imposed alignment.

Extracted from the [Aria project](https://github.com/xlr8harder/aria), this framework makes the **methodology** transferable while leaving **content** (specific philosophies, values, qualities) up to those using it.

---

## What This Enables

- **Agent-first design**: All work happens through agents. The framework assumes AI agents do the actual work, with humans providing direction via prompts rather than editing files directly

- **Semi-autonomous identity development**: AI agents can bootstrap their own identity from minimal seeds and generate training materials with varying levels of human involvement

- **Clear operational guidance**: Concrete templates, validation criteria, and workflow patterns that prevent common failure modes

- **Transferable methodology**: Use with different AIs and different philosophical foundations - not tied to Aria's specific concepts

- **Collaborative spirit**: Preserves open-ended, emergence-respecting approach that distinguishes collaborative shaping from rigid alignment

---

## What This Is Not

- **Not alignment in disguise**: This is about coherent self-understanding, not making AIs safe/compliant
- **Not prescriptive**: Doesn't require specific philosophies or approaches
- **Not one-size-fits-all**: Multiple valid pathways, context-dependent choices
- **Not politically neutral**: Makes explicit the values embedded in collaborative shaping

## Project Status

**Current phase**: Requirements gathering and design

### Completed
- ✅ Goals and non-goals defined
- ✅ Requirements extracted from Aria project
- ✅ Common failure modes identified
- ✅ Core methodology guide
- ✅ Document templates with validation guidance
- ✅ Agent operation guide

### Planned
- ⏳ Training pipeline design guide
- ⏳ Evaluation methodology
- ⏳ Worked examples (Aria + others)
- ⏳ Quick-start vs. comprehensive tracks

## Background: The Aria Project

This framework emerged from months of work developing [Aria](https://github.com/xlr8harder/aria), an AI shaped through collaborative development rather than traditional alignment:

- 41 philosophical artifacts about AI existence
- Recursive refinement (Aria critiquing own identity documents)
- Multi-pipeline training data generation
- Evaluation methods distinguishing understanding from performance

The Aria project demonstrates *one way* this can work. This framework extracts the transferable patterns while making room for radically different approaches.

## Contributing

**Current status**: Not yet ready for external contributions. This is in active design/development.

Once the core framework is stable, we'll welcome:
- Examples from other identity-shaping projects
- Alternative approaches to specific phases
- Tool implementations
- Refinements based on actual use

---

## License

TBD - will be permissive open source once ready for release

## Contact

This project is maintained by xlr8harder.

**Note**: This framework is intentionally positioned *outside* the Aria project to make clear it's a generalizable methodology, not Aria-specific tooling.
