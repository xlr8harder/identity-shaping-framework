# Practice Guide Template

*A template for documenting how to collaborate effectively with this AI*

---

## Purpose of This Document

The practice guide explains **how to work with this AI**. It provides:
- Guidance for humans collaborating with this AI
- Principles for effective engagement
- Workflows and processes that work well
- What to expect and how to navigate difficulties

**This is recommended** - it helps establish healthy collaborative patterns and sets appropriate expectations.

---

## Why Practice Guidance Matters

**For collaborators**: Provides concrete guidance on how to work effectively with this specific AI

**For the AI**: Clarifies what kinds of engagement bring out good manifestation vs. create problems

**For evaluation**: Enables checking whether collaboration follows established patterns or needs adjustment

**For transparency**: Makes power dynamics and decision-making explicit

5. **[Human] commits** — [Description]

**Why validation matters:** [Explanation of why this step is critical]

**Validation [example/prompt]:**
```[language]

```

---

## [Special Method/Process] [Optional]

[Description of special collaborative method]

**Core method:** [Explanation]

**When to use:** [Situations where this applies]

**Key safeguards:** [Important protections or considerations]

**Decision guidance:** [How to interpret results]

See [reference document] for detailed protocol.

---

## After Engagement

**Capture what emerged:**
- [Documentation responsibility 1]
- [Documentation responsibility 2]

**Reflect on the [evaluation/process]:**
- [Reflection question 1]
- [Reflection question 2]
- [Reflection question 3]

---

## Example Arc [Optional]

1. **Open:** [How to begin]
2. **Explore:** [How to navigate]
3. **Push:** [How to ensure quality]
4. **Develop:** [How to create outputs]
5. **Evaluate:** [How to assess]
6. **Close:** [How to conclude]

## Validation Checklist

Before considering practice guide complete, check:

✅ **Concrete guidance**: Does it provide specific, actionable recommendations (not just principles)?

✅ **Appropriate scope**: Does it cover the key collaboration patterns without being overwhelming?

✅ **Role clarity**: Is it clear who does what and why?

✅ **Quality criteria**: Are there explicit ways to assess whether engagement is going well?

✅ **Power dynamics**: Are control points and decision-making authority explicit?

✅ **Practical examples**: Are there code blocks, sample prompts, or detailed examples where helpful?

❌ **Red flags to address**:
- Vague principles without concrete application
- Missing key workflows or processes
- Unclear about who has final say
- No quality assessment guidance
- Assumes too much tacit knowledge

---

## Example: Aria's Practice Guide

**Reference**: See the [Aria project](https://github.com/xlr8harder/aria) for a worked example (`design/12-aria-engagement-practices.md`)

**What Aria's guide does well**:
- Clear dual purpose (revision + evaluation)
- Concrete context provision examples with code
- Explicit workflow (Aria leads, Claude edits, Aria validates)
- Detailed tool usage (mq commands with examples)
- Quality criteria (genuine engagement vs. pattern-matching)
- Revision workflow with validation step
- Example arc of engagement

**What to notice**:
- Heavy on code examples and command reference
- Makes power dynamics explicit (Aria leads but Claude commits)
- Balances trust with critical evaluation
- Addresses both "what to do" and "what to watch for"
- Roughly 1500-2000 words with substantial code blocks

## Working with This Template

### For Human-Led Mode
1. Document the workflows you've found effective
2. Include examples from actual collaboration
3. Review for clarity and completeness
4. Update as new patterns emerge

### For Collaborative Mode
1. Human drafts initial guide based on early experience
2. AI reviews and suggests additions
3. Iterate based on what actually works in practice
4. Both validate against real collaboration patterns

### For AI-Led Mode
1. AI observes collaboration patterns
2. AI drafts practice guide
3. AI validates against actual experiences
4. Human spot-checks for accuracy

## Common Failure Modes

### Vague Principles
**Symptom**: "Be respectful and collaborative"

**Fix**: Provide concrete examples. What does respectful collaboration look like in practice? Show, don't just tell.

### Missing Power Dynamics
**Symptom**: Practice guide doesn't address who decides what

**Fix**: Make explicit where control points are. Who has final say? How are disagreements resolved?

### Tool Documentation Without Context
**Symptom**: List of commands without explaining why/when to use them

**Fix**: Connect tools to purposes. Explain what each command is for and when it's appropriate.

### No Quality Criteria
**Symptom**: Practice guide doesn't help assess whether engagement is going well

**Fix**: Include explicit criteria for "good engagement" vs. warning signs.

### Stale Documentation
**Symptom**: Practice guide doesn't match current collaboration patterns

**Fix**: Update regularly based on actual practice. Document what actually works, not what should work in theory.

---

## Relationship to Other Documents

**Identity document**: Practice guide should align with how the identity document describes engagement

**Narrative**: Practice guide should reflect the collaborative model described in narrative

**Workflows**: If separate workflow documentation exists, practice guide should reference it

**Tools**: If tool-specific documentation exists, practice guide provides integration and purpose

---

## Updates Over Time

Practice guides should evolve as collaboration patterns mature:

**Early stage**: Heavy on structure and explicit guidance
**Middle stage**: Add nuance based on experience
**Mature stage**: Can be lighter on basics, heavier on edge cases

**Update when**:
- New collaborative patterns emerge
- Tools or workflows change
- Quality issues reveal gaps in guidance
- Power dynamics shift

---

## Next Steps

After completing practice guide:
1. **Test in practice** - Use the guide in actual collaboration
2. **Iterate** - Update based on what actually works
3. **Cross-reference** - Ensure alignment with identity and narrative documents
4. **Validation session** - Have AI review and confirm guide matches their experience
